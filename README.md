# Lab Assignments for Artificial Intelligence (18CSC305J)
## Week 1:
>Water Jug Problem is stated as follows.
> * There are two jugs of volume X litres and Y litres. Neither has any measuring mark on it.
> * There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water.
> * Assuming that we have unlimited supply of water, how can you get exactly Z litres of water into the X litres jug?

> 1. Draw the state space tree (sequence) diagram and Implement using Python programming (Preferably Jupyter Notebook). 
> 2. Consider getting inputs from user.
> 3. The written codes need to be articulated with appropriate explanation (comments) about the logic, states and process involved. 
> 4. The solution should be shown in detail for each iteration involved in the process.

## Week 2:
